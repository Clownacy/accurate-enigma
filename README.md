# accurate-enigma

This project aims to produce a compressor for the 'Enigma' compression format
which outputs data that is identical to Sega's compressor.

You can read more about Enigma here:

Currently, the compressor is mostly accurate, but it often fails to select the
correct incremental copy word. If anyone can figure out the method that the
original compressor used to choose the incremental copy word, please let me
know.
